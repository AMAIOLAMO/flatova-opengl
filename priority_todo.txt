HIGH:
- Mouse scrolling camera speed up
- Allow deletion of entities (requires hashmap indirection pointing towards the table)

MID:
- UI scaling is inconsistent with different DPIs (allow customized scaling?)
    - Maybe allow the user to tone up the scaling of the window using arguments? its much easier that way
- Render the scene in a separate window (Requires Frame buffers and render textures) call it Viewport
- simplistic gizmos implementation, or blender like short cut controls (g for grab, r for rotate, etc etc)
- Customize keybinds (Allow a settings)

LOW:
- UI's default position should be scaled based on anchor position
- create an action undo and redo system

UNKNOWN:

---

COMPLETE:
- [X] rewrite the model loading to allow them to load triangulated meshes instead (ignoring any other type of mesh, and or triangulation)
- [X] write a makefile for others to initialize the project easily,
    especially for meson compile -C build, meson clean and meson setup build for compilation
- [X] Make Add button more obvious
