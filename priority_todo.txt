HIGH:
- Mouse scrolling camera speed up (Display in engine directly)
- simplistic gizmos implementation, or blender like short cut controls ([X]g for grab, r for rotate, etc etc)
    - should display Editor Mode in the UI for user feedback (top middle)
- every entity should have a name component, can be displayed in scene hierarchy(Meta component?)
    - entity with name component can be renamed



MID:
- UI scaling is inconsistent with different DPIs (allow customized scaling?)
    - Maybe allow the user to tone up the scaling of the window using arguments? its much easier that way
- Render the scene in a separate window (Requires Frame buffers and render textures) call it Viewport
- Customize keybinds (Allow setting keybind map[reference from other engines?])
- Simple Shadow map implementation
- instead of using booleans for ECS, utilize uint64_t / uint32_t instead, so around 32 / 64 components to be used



LOW:
- UI's default position should be scaled based on anchor position (Add an anchor scaling based on screen size)
- create an action undo and redo system



UNKNOWN:


---

COMPLETE:
- [X] Load images by default to be nearest
- [X] rewrite the model loading to allow them to load triangulated meshes instead (ignoring any other type of mesh, and or triangulation)
- [X] write a makefile for others to initialize the project easily,
    especially for meson compile -C build, meson clean and meson setup build for compilation
- [X] Make Add button more obvious
- [X] Add categories in resources, load resources by type
- [X] Allow deletion of entities (requires hashmap indirection pointing towards the table)
- [X] Entities with mesh render should be able to render with a selection outline
