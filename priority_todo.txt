HIGH:
- Mouse scrolling camera speed up
- rewrite the model loading to allow them to load triangulated meshes instead (ignoring any other type of mesh, and or triangulation)
- write a makefile for others to initialize the project easily,
    especially for meson compile -C build, meson clean and meson setup build for compilation

MID:
- UI scaling is inconsistent with different DPIs (allow customized scaling?)
    - Maybe allow the user to tone up the scaling of the window using arguments? its much easier that way
- Render the scene in a separate window (Requires Frame buffers and render textures) call it Viewport
- simplistic gizmos implementation, or blender like short cut controls (g for grab, r for rotate, etc etc)

LOW:
- UI's default position should be scaled based on anchor position

UNKNOWN:
